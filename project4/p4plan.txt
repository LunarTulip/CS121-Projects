I (Alyssa Riceman) will be working alone for this project.

My game will be about a trio of magical girls in a city made of clouds attempting to overthrow the evil overlord who's taken the place over. One particular gameplay gimmick I plan on including is protagonist-hopping: whenever the player character dies (e.g. killed by monsters or by a trap or whatever), rather than ending the game, the viewpoint will jump to one of the other protagonists, who will then continue as the new PC in the same run, with the plot continuing to move forward and so on. Each of them will have different spells, different personalities (as shown through, for instance, different descriptions given upon examining the same objects, and different dialogue options), and different means of problem-solving (for instance, one of them is far more capable of "bash down the door"-type tactics than the other two).
